## 5 Steps of Critical thinking

```
Identify the problem

Gather information

Analyze the information

Make a decision or conclusion

Implement the decision, evaluate, and learn
```

## Whiteboard

Ability to think critically 

Break down complex problems into smaller components 

Explain their thought process in a clear and concise manner

Coding skills 

Ability to write clean and efficient code

```
Write down the question. Write down the problem in its entirity and read it aloud. ...
Write down examples. ...
Take time to write clearly. ...
Use double-spaced lines. ...
Use the space provided efficiently.
```

### Tips

Blank Out - stay calm go back a few steps. 
The approach is not clear - caught edge cases before coding.   
The Approach is wrong - double check - correct wrong approach and explaing why.

### System Design (Building Blocks)

System Component - Architectural Diagrams

Service Based Architecture

service self contained unit of functionality with an api interface that allows
other components to interact with it. 

- separate db for separate service - decouple services 

- performs specific functionality in system
- Modularity and Reusability
- flexibilty and agility

### Coding problems 
Data Structures and Algorithms 

Systematic approach  

- Not asking clarifying questions in beginning
- Coding Without planning also discuss (plan algorithm)
- Freaking out if you get stuck 
- Not testing you're solution  - test cases define

Optimisation 

(Reacto)

approach
-----------------
code
test
optimisation

* Repeat the question
* Write out examples 
* Input/Output (Understand the black box)
* Describe your approach
(iterative/recursive)
* Confirm approach
* Write your code

Breakdown approach into smaller steps (High Level) core algo is right 
Room for edits (space between)
Star things you are not sure about
Psuedo Code ok 
Test - examples and run through code (another colour marker variables)
Optimization and runtime (perform under larger datasets) Big O 
Make Interview comfortable and lets them whats going on
